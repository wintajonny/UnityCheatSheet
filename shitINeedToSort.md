## Character Controller Unity
Instead of Rigidbody on Player Character

## IsTrigger
GameObject acts like a 'cloud'
- Collider Component with IsTrigger acts as a trigger instead of a physical collider - will no longer have a solid barrier - but can still detect entry by the player or another GameObject


#Programming
Public variables are changeable in the Inspector Window of Unity
Using statements link the Script to the necessary libraries
- so when you enter something like 'Rigidbody' the script knows what that means

Monobehaviour is a required class for all GameObjects in Unity.
- This bit of code is what allows you to add your script as a component to a GameObject.
