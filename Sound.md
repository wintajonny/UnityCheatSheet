# Sound
The Player needs an Audio Listener Component to hear sounds
- Only ONE is allowed in Unity


## Audio Source Component
- The Audio Resource contains the wanted audio
- Loop if wanted
- For 3D sound (where it changes Volume by distance) Spatial Blend = 1


For Background Music - Create an extra GameObject With Audio Source that 'you' can hear everywhere

## Preverb Zones
Preverb Zones are used to "reflect and reverberate" Sound in physical space

# Where to find Music Samples:
